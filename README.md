## _Match-up DataBase for Validation of Satellite Data using HYPSTAR_

The Match-up Data Base (MDB) includes match-ups between different satellite sensors and in situ data. It was developed as a way to improve the exchange, and processing of match-up data among different entities based on the concept by EUMETSAT (https://ocdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ocdb-MDB-user-manual.html). There is one MDB file for each site and satellite sensor.
